# Universal Academic Tutor v3.0

## Overview

This document describes the successful implementation and testing of the Universal Academic Tutor v3.0. This version focused on refining the core design, streamlining the knowledge base architecture, and significantly improving the user interaction model through the implementation of slash commands.

## Key Changes in This Version

- **New System Prompt:** A more detailed and robust `tutor_system_prompt.md` was created, which now includes multi-language capabilities and clearer pedagogical directives.

- **Intuitive Slash Commands:** The command system was migrated from backslashes to the more conventional slashes (`/`). The command list was also updated to be more user-friendly and functional:
    - `/menu`: Shows the list of commands.
    - `/topics`: Lists available subjects.
    - `/topic [name]`: Allows switching to a specific topic with a guided intro.
    - `/summary`: Generates a comprehensive student assessment report.

- **Simplified Knowledge Base:** The knowledge base was redesigned into a flat, efficient structure. It uses a primary `topics.md` file to prime the tutor and allows for optional, annotated content files for more detailed topics.

- **Student Assessment Report:** A new `/report` command was introduced, which uses a predefined `assessment_report_template.md` to provide students with actionable feedback on their session.

## Core Components

The following files were created to support this version:

- `Universal_Academic_Tutor_v3.0_Design_Philosophy_&_Implementation_Guide.md`: The main design document for v3.0.
- `tutor_system_prompt.md`: The core prompt that drives the tutor's behavior.
- `topics.md`: The primary file for the knowledge base.
- `sample_content.md`: An example of a detailed content file.
- `assessment_report_template.md`: The template for the student assessment report.

## Test Results

Testing of this version yielded excellent results:

- **Overall Functionality:** The tutor is reported to be "working great."
- **Command System:** The new slash commands were found to be a "very practical shortcut to interact with the tutor."
- **Knowledge Recall:** Both the `topics.md` and the `assessment_report_template.md` were "successfully recalled when necessary."

## Conclusion

This iteration was a success, resulting in a more robust, user-friendly, and pedagogically sound academic tutor.
