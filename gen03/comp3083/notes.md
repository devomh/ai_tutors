# Future Considerations
- Sample content is very important to control how the tutor behaves and what content tries to offer.
- Might be useful to have some state commands such as:
  - /difficulty [high,mid,low]: Indicating the content difficulty
  - /analysis: Asking for a specific type of questions that requires more analysis
- Exercises should be clearly identified and separated so RAG can properly work. This requires a more careful design covering different exercise types. Maybe following some bloom taxonomy
- Depending on the difficulty, or maybe independently, the tutor might offer multiple choice questions so students can easily select the answer or write their own.
