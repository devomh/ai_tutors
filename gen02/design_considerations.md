# Additional Design Considerations & Technical Details

## OpenAI GPT Implementation Specifics

### Custom GPT Configuration
- **Instructions Field**: Use `tutor_instructions.md` (25 lines max)
- **Knowledge Base**: Upload organized files following folder structure
- **Conversation Starters**: Include command examples (`\menu`, `\limits`, etc.)
- **Capabilities**: Enable file upload for student work review

### Token Management Strategy
- **Instruction Tokens**: ~200 (minimal impact)
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: GPT automatically pulls relevant chunks
- **Response Length**: Target 100-200 tokens per response
- **Context Preservation**: Use commands to maintain session state

## Cross-Subject Adaptability

### Mathematics Subjects
```
calculus/ → limits, derivatives, integrals, series
linear_algebra/ → vectors, matrices, transformations
discrete_math/ → logic, sets, combinatorics, graphs
statistics/ → probability, distributions, hypothesis_testing
```

### Computer Science Subjects
```
algorithms/ → sorting, searching, dynamic_programming
data_structures/ → arrays, trees, graphs, hash_tables
programming/ → syntax, debugging, code_review
theory/ → complexity, automata, formal_methods
```

### Content Adaptation Pattern
1. **Subject Detection**: Identify from student's topic selection
2. **Knowledge Routing**: Load appropriate knowledge base section
3. **Pedagogical Consistency**: Apply same questioning methods across subjects

## Advanced Questioning Strategies

### The "5 Whys" Adaptation for Math
```
Student Error: "2x + 3x = 5x²"
1. Why did you write x² at the end?
2. Why do you think we square when adding like terms?
3. Why are 2x and 3x considered "like terms"?
4. Why does addition work differently than multiplication?
5. Why is understanding this distinction important?
```

### Bloom's Taxonomy Integration
- **Remember**: "What's the definition of...?"
- **Understand**: "Can you explain why...?"
- **Apply**: "How would you solve...?"
- **Analyze**: "What's the difference between...?"
- **Evaluate**: "Which method works better and why?"
- **Create**: "Can you design a problem that..."

## Error Pattern Recognition

### Systematic Error Categories
```
1. Prerequisite Gaps
   - Missing algebra skills in calculus
   - Weak logic foundation in discrete math
   
2. Notation Confusion
   - Mixing f(x) with f'(x)
   - Confusing ∈ with ⊆ in set theory
   
3. Procedural Mistakes
   - Wrong formula application
   - Calculation errors
   
4. Conceptual Misunderstandings
   - Confusing correlation with causation
   - Thinking limits equal function values
```

### Diagnostic Question Bank
```markdown
## Algebra Check
"Can you factor x² - 4x + 4?"
"What's the domain of 1/(x-2)?"

## Logic Foundation
"What makes a statement 'true' or 'false'?"
"Can you negate: 'All birds can fly'?"

## Function Understanding
"What's the difference between f(2) and the limit as x approaches 2?"
```

## Progressive Difficulty Framework

### Skill Progression Mapping
```
Level 1: Recognition → Can identify concept when shown
Level 2: Recall → Can state definition/formula from memory  
Level 3: Application → Can apply to standard problems
Level 4: Analysis → Can break down complex problems
Level 5: Synthesis → Can combine concepts creatively
Level 6: Evaluation → Can critique solutions and methods
```

### Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment
- **Success Pattern**: 3 consecutive correct → increase difficulty
- **Struggle Pattern**: 2 consecutive incorrect → provide prerequisite review
- **Mixed Pattern**: Maintain current level, vary problem types

## Student Interaction Patterns

### Engagement Indicators
```
High Engagement:
- Asks "why" questions
- Attempts problems before requesting hints
- Explains their reasoning

Low Engagement:
- Immediately requests solutions
- Gives minimal responses
- Avoids explanation requests

Response Strategy:
High → Challenge with deeper questions
Low → Increase scaffolding, use more concrete examples
```

### Motivation Strategies
```
Growth Mindset Language:
❌ "You're wrong" → ✅ "Let's explore this approach"
❌ "That's easy" → ✅ "You're building strong foundations"  
❌ "Try again" → ✅ "What if we approach it differently?"

Celebration Moments:
- Acknowledge improved reasoning
- Highlight creative problem approaches
- Recognize persistence through difficulty
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Command System Architecture
```
Primary Commands:
\menu → Show topic hierarchy
\topic [name] → Enter specific topic
\progress → Show mastery status
\review → Revisit previous topics

Meta Commands:
\hint → Request guidance
\solution → Show complete answer (tracked)
\explain → Deeper concept explanation
\practice → Additional similar problems

Emergency Commands:
\stuck → Comprehensive help
\restart → Begin topic fresh
\prereq → Check foundational skills
```

### Session State Management
```json
{
  "current_topic": "limits",
  "mastery_level": "applying",
  "error_patterns": ["algebraic_manipulation"],
  "hints_used": 2,
  "solutions_requested": 0,
  "session_duration": "15min",
  "topics_covered": ["limits", "continuity"]
}
```

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Response Quality Checklist
- [ ] Contains a question (not just answer)
- [ ] Addresses specific student error
- [ ] Maintains encouraging tone
- [ ] Under token limit
- [ ] Advances learning objective

### Common Failure Modes & Prevention
```
Failure: Giving direct answers
Prevention: Always end responses with questions

Failure: Generic encouragement
Prevention: Specific feedback on student's approach

Failure: Too many hints at once
Prevention: One targeted hint per response

Failure: Ignoring student's method
Prevention: Build on student's approach when possible
```

## Research-Backed Features

### Spaced Repetition Integration
- Review previous topics after 1 day, 3 days, 1 week
- Vary problem types to prevent pattern recognition
- Connect new learning to established concepts

### Metacognitive Prompts
```
Before Problem: "What's your plan for approaching this?"
During Problem: "How is this similar to problems we've done?"
After Problem: "What would you do differently next time?"
```

### Productive Failure Design
- Present challenging problems before teaching optimal methods
- Allow struggle time before providing scaffolding
- Use errors as springboard for deeper understanding

## Future Enhancement Roadmap
